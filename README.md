# Online Normalization

Implementation of
[Online Normalization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05894).
Different implementations of Online Normalization can be found in the
`online_norm` folder. Code to reproduce experimental results can be found in
the `experimentation` folder. The `examples` folder has minimally modified
versions of commonly trained networks, modified to replace Batch Normalization
with Online Normalization.
